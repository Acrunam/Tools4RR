## Thoughts on changes for future versions of course

- Add in-class exercises in each lecture
- Have weekly or biweekly assignments that build to a full project
- Have projects be in teams of two
- git: discuss pull vs fetch+merge vs fetch+rebase
- git: discuss revert (and rewind?)
- testing: discuss Travis CI and `devtools::add_travis()`
