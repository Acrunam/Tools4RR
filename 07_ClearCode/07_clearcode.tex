\bi
\item Code that works
    \bi
    \item[] No bugs; efficiency is secondary (or tertiary)
    \ei
\item Readable
    \bi
    \item[] Fixable; extendable
    \ei
\item Reuseable
    \bi
    \item[] Modular; reasonably general
    \ei
\item Reproducible
    \bi
    \item[] Re-runnable
    \ei
\item Think before you code
    \bi
    \item[] More thought $\implies$ fewer bugs/re-writes
    \ei
\item Learn from others' code
    \bi
    \item[] R itself; key R packages
    \ei

\note{Our first goal should be to get the right answer.

  But we also want to write code that we (and others) will be able to
  use again. Efficiency is way down on the list of needs.

  Write clearly, and re-write.

  Break things down into small, re-usable functions, written in a
  general way, but not {\nvhilit too} general. You want to actually
  solve a particular problem.

  Step 1 is to stop and think.

  Step 2: write re-usable functions rather than a script.

  By reproducible/re-runnable, I mean: don't have a bunch of code from
  which you copy-and-paste in a special way.
