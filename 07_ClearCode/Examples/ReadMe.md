## Writing clear code: Examples

Here are some links to R packages to look at.

- My [R/broman package](https://github.com/kbroman/broman)

- My [R/qtl package](https://github.com/kbroman/qtl)

  - _Really_ bad example:
    [scantwo](https://github.com/kbroman/qtl/blob/master/R/scantwo.R)
  - Some good and some bad examples:
    [util.R](https://github.com/kbroman/qtl/blob/master/R/util.R)
  - The good code is mostly in C:
    [hmm_main.c](https://github.com/kbroman/qtl/blob/master/src/hmm_main.c), 
    [hmm_bc.c](https://github.com/kbroman/qtl/blob/master/src/hmm_bc.c)

- [Hadley Wickham](http://had.co.nz/)'s [assertthat](https://github.com/hadley/assertthat) and
  [testthat](https://github.com/hadley/testthat) packages
