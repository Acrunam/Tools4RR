How to do a pull request on bitbucket

(This only seems to work if you've _forked_ someone's repository.)


1. push change to bitbucket

   - make change
   - git add, git commit
   - git push

2. On bitbucket website: go to _your_ version of the repository

3. Top right, Icon + "Pull request"

4. You're repository on left; person that you want to pull on right

5. Perhaps add a description.
