  \note{This is an introductory lecture for a special topics course at
    UW{\textendash}Madison on tools for reproducible research.

A minimal standard for data analysis and other scientific computations
is that they be {\color{nhilight} reproducible}: that the code and data are assembled
in a way so that another group can re-create all of the results (e.g.,
the figures in a paper). The importance of such reproducibility is now
widely recognized, but it is not so widely practiced as it should be,
in large part because many computational scientists (and particularly
statisticians) have not fully adopted the required tools for
reproducible research.

In this course, we will discuss general principles for reproducible
research but will focus primarily on the use of relevant tools
(particularly \href{http://www.gnu.org/software/make}{\tt make},
\href{http://git-scm.com}{\tt git}, and \href{http://github.com}{\tt knitr}),
with the goal that the students leave the course ready and willing to
ensure that all aspects of their computational research (software,
data analyses, papers, presentations, posters) are reproducible.}

\only<1|handout 0>{{\color{background} invisible text}}
\only<2>{Replicable}
\only<3 | handout 0>{Correct}

\note{Computational work is
  {\color{nhilight} reproducible} if one can take the data and code and produce
  the same set of result. {\color{nhilight} Replicable} is more stringent: can
  someone repeat the experiment and get the same results?

  Reproducibility is a minimal standard. That something is
  reproducible doesn't imply that it is correct. The code may have bugs. The
  methods may be poorly behaved. There could be experimental
  artifacts.

  (But reproducibility is probably correlated with correctness.)

  Note that some scientists say replicable for what I call
  reproducible, and vice versa.

\begin{frame}{Levels of quality}


\vspace{24pt}

\bi
\itemsep12pt
\item Are the tables and figures reproducible from the code and data?
\item Does the code actually do what you think it does?
\item In addition to {\color{hilight} what} was done, is it clear
  {\color{hilight} why} it was done?
  \bi
  \item[] (e.g., how were parameter settings chosen?)
  \ei
\item Can the code be used for other data?
\item Can you extend the code to do other things?
\ei

\note{Reproducibility is not black and white. And the ideal is hard to
  achieve.

How far back to you go?

\note{Data that I get from collaborators has usually gone through a
  considerable amount of pre-processing. Should we have captured that,
  in order for the work to be considered reproducible?
}
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Basic principles}


\vspace{24pt}

\bi
\itemsep12pt
\item Everything via code
\item Everything automated
\item Get the data in the most-raw form possible
\item Get any/all data and meta-data possible
\item Keep track of the {\color{hilight} provenance} of all data files
\item Be self-sufficient
\ei

\note{Pointing and clicking is not reproducible. Ideally, you press
  just one button.

Make sure you have all of the data and that you know exactly where it
came from.

If your collaborator asks, ``In what form would you like the data?''
you should respond, ``In its current form.''
}
\end{frame}




\begin{frame}{Basic tools}


\vspace{24pt}

\bi
\itemsep12pt
\item Make
\item Unix command line
\item Latex and Markdown
\item Knitr
\item Version control with git
\item R packages
\item Python (or Ruby or Perl)
\ei

\note{These are the basic tools that I think are important for
  reproducible computational research; they form the core topics for
  the course.

  Make is for automation and for documenting dependencies. For
  reproducibility, the command line is your best friend. Latex and
  Markdown allow preparation of beautiful documents without pointing
  or clicking. Knitr is for combining code and text; knitr and make
  are the key tools for reproducibility. Version control isn't
  strictly necessary for reproducibility, but once you get the hang of
  it, you'll never go back. R's packaging system is among its best
  features. A scripting language like Python is invaluable for
  manipulating data files. Many things that are awkward in R are easy
  in Python.

\begin{frame}{Other topics}


\vspace{24pt}

\bi
\itemsep12pt
\item Organizing projects
\item Writing clear code
\item Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)
\item Testing and debugging
\item Handling big jobs
\item Licenses; human subjects data
\ei

\note{I'll also cover all of these things.

The organization of the data and code for a project is a major
determinant of whether others will be able to make sense of it.
Good code is not just correct but is clearly written. Code is easier
to maintain and understand if it is modular. Adding good tests will
help you to find problems in your code earlier rather than later. But
you'll spend a lot of time debugging, so we should talk about
debugging strategies. Big computational jobs (particularly big
computer simulations) raise additional issues; reproducibility is
especially tricky. Finally, code that you distribute should be
licensed. And if you're working with data on human subjects, you
need to be extra careful.
