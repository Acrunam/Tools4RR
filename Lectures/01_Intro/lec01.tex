  \note{This is an introductory lecture for a special topics course at
    UW{\textendash}Madison on tools for reproducible research.

A minimal standard for data analysis and other scientific computations
is that they be {\color{nhilight} reproducible}: that the code and data are assembled
in a way so that another group can re-create all of the results (e.g.,
the figures in a paper). The importance of such reproducibility is now
widely recognized, but it is not so widely practiced as it should be,
in large part because many computational scientists (and particularly
statisticians) have not fully adopted the required tools for
reproducible research.

In this course, we will discuss general principles for reproducible
research but will focus primarily on the use of relevant tools
(particularly \href{http://www.gnu.org/software/make}{\tt make},
\href{http://git-scm.com}{\tt git}, and \href{http://github.com}{\tt knitr}),
with the goal that the students leave the course ready and willing to
ensure that all aspects of their computational research (software,
data analyses, papers, presentations, posters) are reproducible.}

\note{Computational work is
  {\color{nhilight} reproducible} if one can take the data and code and produce
  the same set of result. {\color{nhilight} Replicable} is more stringent: can
  someone repeat the experiment and get the same results?

  Reproducibility is a minimal standard. That something is
  reproducible doesn't imply that it is correct. The code may have bugs. The
  methods may be poorly behaved. There could be experimental
  artifacts.

  (But reproducibility is probably correlated with correctness.)

  considerable amount of pre-processing. Should we have captured that,
  in order for the work to be considered reproducible?
