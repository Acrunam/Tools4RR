### Example of knitr with R Markdown

`example.Rmd` is a simple example of an
[R Markdown](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/docs/r_markdown) file,
combining R code and
[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), and with the
ability to use [MathJax](http://www.mathjax.org/) to include
[LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org/)-type code for equations.

`Makefile` is the [GNU make](http://www.gnu.org/software/make) file
for using [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/) to convert the R Markdown
file to html.
