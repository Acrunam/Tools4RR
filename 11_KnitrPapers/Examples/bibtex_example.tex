\maketitle

A number of investigators have developed methods for identifying such
sample mix-ups \citep{Westra2011, Schadt2012, Lynch2012, Ekstrom2012},
and a similar approach was applied by \citet{Baggerly2008,
Baggerly2009} in their forensic bioinformatics analyses of the Duke
debacle.  We have developed a further approach that is simple but
effective.  We illustrate its use through a particularly dramatic
example.
