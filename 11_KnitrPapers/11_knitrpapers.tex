\note{
  This lecture is about how to create reproducible manuscripts, for
  journal articles. KnitR with R Markdown is great for informal
  reports. KnitR with AsciiDoc is great for somewhat fancier
  reports. There are a number of efforts, especially with Pandoc, to
  use R Markdown for journal articles. But if you want fine control
  over the appearance of a document, it's hard to beat \LaTeX, and so
  I'm just going to focus on that.

\begin{frame}[c,fragile]{\LaTeX}

\documentclass[12pt]{article}

\title{An example document}
\author{Karl Broman}

\begin{document}

\maketitle
\thispagestyle{empty}

\section{A section}

This is a simple example of a \LaTeX\/ document for an article.
Here's some in-line math: $y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \epsilon$.

And here's a display equation:

$$ \hat{\beta} = (X'X)^{-1} X'y $$

\end{document}
\end{lstlisting}

\note{
  \LaTeX\/ is like html or Markdown: plain text with special codes to
  indicate how things are to appear.

  A \LaTeX\/ document always starts with {\tt {\textbackslash}documentclass}, then a
  bunch of overall controlling information. The actual document is
  between {\tt {\textbackslash}begin\{document\}} and {\tt {\textbackslash}end\{document\}}.

  {\tt {\textbackslash}usepackage\{\}} is like {\tt library()} in R.

  Ideally, you focus on {\nhilit semantics} rather than {\nhilit
  style}: define the {\tt {\textbackslash}title\{\}} and {\tt {\textbackslash}author\{\}} and use
  {\tt {\textbackslash}maketitle} to have them included in the document, and
  indicate sections and subsections with {\tt {\textbackslash}section\{\}} and
  {\tt {\textbackslash}subsection\{\}}.

  For some reason, {\tt {\textbackslash}thispagestyle\{empty\}} (``don't
  show page number on this page'') needs
  to be placed {\nhilit after} {\tt {\textbackslash}maketitle}.

  A key feature of \LaTeX\/ is the mathematics typesetting. There's no
  better system. And your \LaTeX\/ skills can be immediately
  transferred to your Markdown documents.

\begin{frame}{Why \LaTeX\/?}

\bbi
\item Fine control of document appearance
\item Transparency of how that was achieved
\item Version control (diff/merge)
\item Typesetting equations
\item Markdown's not quite ready, or sufficiently rich
\ei


\note{
  It's {\nhilit a lot} of work to learn \LaTeX, so we need to be clear
  about why we'd want to devote the effort to it.

  For reproducible research, we need some sort of code-based document
  system (i.e., {\nvhilit not Word!}), and \LaTeX\/ gives you the most
  fine-grained control, if you need it. Ultimately, I hope, Markdown
  will be sufficient, but for now, we often need \LaTeX\/.

  The code-based control makes what you're trying to do
  transparent.  And you should treat \LaTeX\/ like code: write clearly
  and simply, and comment the tricky bits.

  This sort of document also has the advantage of easy treatment of
  {\tt diff} and {\tt merge} in a version control system like git.

  The real power of \LaTeX\/ is in the typesetting of mathematical
  equations. And what you learn on that aspect can be transferred to
  your Markdown documents, using MathJax.

Modify your desires to match the defaults.

\vspace{36pt}

Focus your compulsive behavior on things that matter.

\note{
  I've said this before, but I like to repeat it.

  Focus on the text and the figures before worrying too much about
  fine details of how they appear on the page.

  And consider which is more important: a manuscript, web page, blog,
  grant, course slides, course handout, report to collaborator,
  scientific poster.

  You can spend a ton of time trying to get things to look just
  right. Ideally, you spend that time trying to construct a general
  solution.  Or you can modify your desires to more closely match what
  you get without any effort.

\note{
  KnitR works well with LaTeX.

  Most of what you learned about KnitR with RMarkdown transfers
  directly to working with LaTeX.

  The main difference is the way in which code chunks are
  indicated. You use {\tt <<>>=} and {\tt @} for chunks, and
  {\tt {\textbackslash}Sexpr\{\}} for in-line code.

  The chunk options are the same. Here, I used
  {\tt out.width="0.8{\textbackslash\textbackslash}textwidth"}
  to make the figure appear as 80\% of the width of the page.

  {\tt out.width} and {\tt out.height} need units as in \LaTeX\/ (built into
  {\tt {\textbackslash\textbackslash}textwidth}; otherwise {\tt "in"}
  or {\tt "cm"} or {\tt "pt"} or whatever).

  {\tt fig.width} and {\tt fig.height} are as in R, with implied units.

  it.
