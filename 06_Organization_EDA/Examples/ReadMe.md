### Example of an R file for knitr `spin()`

`example.R` is a simple example of an
R file with [Roxygen2](https://github.com/klutometis/roxygen)-like comments, 
which `spin()` will convert to an R Markdown file, then to Markdown,
then to html.

`Makefile` is the [GNU make](http://www.gnu.org/software/make) file
for using [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/) to convert the R
file to html.
