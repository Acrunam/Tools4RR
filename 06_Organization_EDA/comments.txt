Many-side-projects problem:

  Have periodic "versions" for the project, perhaps labeled by date
    - Move all the good stuff over and retire the crappy stuff

  Put defunct side projects into an Old/ subdirectory
  Put active but not yet clearly interesting ones into New/ or Play/

Syncing with collaborators (e.g., on a paper)

  If then send you a marked-up PDF, save it an a coauthor-specific
  folder, then incorporate and commit the changes yourself.

Syncing between computers?

  Maybe Dropbox or Google Drive would be better than git/github, for
  grabbing all of those huge intermediate files that you don't want under
  version control but also don't want to reconstruct every time.
