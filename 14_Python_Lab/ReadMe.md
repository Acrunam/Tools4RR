# Python lab

For a bit of in-class python coding, we'll fill out a Python script to
read in a comma-delimited file, and calculate, for each column:

- Number of non-missing values
- Mean
- Median
- SD

Here are the relevant files:

- [`data.csv`](data.csv) &mdash; the data file to consider
- [`stats.py`](stats.py) &mdash; the script to be filled in
- [`test_stats.py`](test_stats.py) &mdash; unit tests, if time allows

Also relevant:

- [`create_example_data.py`] &mdash; the Python script I wrote to
  generate the [`data.csv`](data.csv) file.
- [`answers_DONT_PEEK.py`](answers_DONT_PEEK.py) &mdash; my solutions
  (don't look at this until later)
