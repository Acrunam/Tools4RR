\note{
  Reproducibility is a bit harder for computational tasks that take
  more than just a couple of hours.

  And I've had papers where the computations required more than a year
  of CPU time (split across many computers).

  The problems are: (a) it's hard for someone to re-do all of that
  work, and (b) large-scale calculations tend to be organized in a
  system-dependent way, so even if time weren't a factor, it'd be that
  much harder to transfer the calculations to another system.

  Simulations have some special issues (e.g., saving the seeds for
  random number generators), and they are notoriously irreproducible.

\note{
  Use {\tt R CMD BATCH} to run an R job in the background.

  Use {\tt \&} to put it in the background.

  Use {\tt nice +19} to give it low priority.

  Use {\tt fg} to bring a job back into the foreground.

  Use {\tt ctrl-Z} to suspend a current job; then use {\tt bg} to put it
  in the background.

  Use {\tt ps ux} or {\tt top} to view current jobs.

  Use {\tt kill} or {\tt kill -9} with a process ID ({\tt PID} in the
  output of {\tt ps} and {\tt top}) to kill a job.

\item You don't want {\tt knitr} running for a year.

\item You don't want to re-run things if you don't have to.

\note{
  It may not seem like ``big jobs'' are that big of a deal, but in my
  mind this is the only real difficulty.
