\note{
  An often neglected aspect in discussions of reproducible research:
  software and data need to be licensed. If you want your software and
  data to be reused, you need to provide an explicit license that
  explains exactly how the software and data may be reused.

  I'm going to try to explain the issues and give suggestions about
  licenses to consider. But I'm no expert, and I'm definitely {\nhilit
  not a lawyer}. I don't guarantee that this is entirely correct.

  If you will be sharing data on human subjects, or, for that matter,
  just working with data on human subjects, you need to be extra
  careful. I'll try to sketch the basic concerns.

\begin{frame}{Intellectual property}

\bbi
\item Manuscripts/journal articles
\item Books
\item Software
\item Data set
\item Ideas, inventions
\item Lab/research notebooks
\item Instructional materials
\item Web sites
\ei

\note{
 Intellectual property is property (ie, someone can own it) that is not
 an actual thing but more the idea of the thing. For example, it's not
 the actual physical book, but the text in the book. It's
 not an actual physical art work, but any depiction of the content of
 that artwork. This can get pretty complicated; it's best to move on.
 
 Most of what academics produce is intellectual property.

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{IP protection}

\bbi
\item Copyright
\item Patents
\item Trademarks, Trade "dress"
\item Trade secrets
\ei

\note{
  Different kinds of intellectual property is protected in different
  ways. I'm going to focus on copyright.

  An important point to mention here is that an {\nhilit idea},
  {\nhilit fact} or {\nhilit algorithm} can't be copyrighted. Ideas
  and algorithms can be protected with a patent, but {\nhilit facts}
  (including individual data points) can be neither copyrighted nor
  patented.

  So, for example, copyright protection says that you may not be able
  to copy and use someone's exact code, but you can grab all of the
  ideas and re-implement them in your own way. Unless the ideas or
  algorithms are patented, and then you have to get their permission
  to use them, even if it's your own implementation.

\begin{frame}{Copyright}

\bbi
\item Copyright is automatic
\item In "works for hire," the employer holds the copyright
\item In academics, it is customary that researchers control copyright
\onslide<2->{\item At
  \href{https://grad.wisc.edu/acadpolicy/\#responsibleconductofresearch}{UW-Madison}:
    \vspace{6pt}

    \begin{quote} \footnotesize \lolit
      "Except as required by funding agreements or other university
      policies, the university does not claim ownership rights in the
      intellectual property generated during research by its faculty,
      staff, or students."
    \end{quote}
}

\ei

\note{
  \vspace{-8pt}
  Since 1978, works you create are automatically copyrighted. That
  includes data, software, papers, books, talks, posters, course syllabi,
  and lecture notes. Since 1989, you don't need to include a copyright notice.

  In many job situations, your employer will own the copyright on
  works that you create as part of your employment.  But in academic
  settings, it is traditional that researchers retain copyright on the
  works they create. But there are exceptions, and universities are
  increasingly interested in generating income from the intellectual
  property of their faculty.

  Also, students may be treated somewhat different from other
  employees. Academic staff may be treated differently from faculty,
  for that matter. Ideally, the exact rules are written down
  somewhere. Find the rules and read them, and ask questions about
  them.  

  At UW-Madison, faculty, staff, and students own the intellectual
  property of the works they produce except in some special cases,
  such as instructional materials produced with significant university
  resources. And if you're going to patent something, it must be
  through the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (WARF).

\begin{frame}{Exclusive rights under copyright}

\bbi
\item To make copies of the work
\item To distribute/sell copies of the work
\item To create derivative works
\item To perform the work
\item To display the work publicly

\note{
  Copyright protection gives the author exclusive rights to the work
  and to derivatives of the work.

\begin{frame}{Fair use}

\vspace{18pt}

Reproduction for criticism/commentary, teaching, and research

\vspace{12pt}

\bi
\item For non-commercial or nonprofit educational purposes
\item Can't be a substantial portion of the work
\item Can't effect the value/market of the original work
\ei

\note{
  There are important limitations to copyright protection.

  We are allowed to reproduce portions of a work as part of a
  criticism or commentary, in teaching, or for research.

  The rules aren't precise. 

  Quoting from a work is okay. Posting the full thing on the web is
  not.

\note{
  Just in case it's not clear: the tradition of citing one's sources
  is really totally different from following copyright law.

  Works in the public domain should still be appropriately cited.

\end{frame}





\begin{frame}{Software licenses}

\bbi
\item Critical if you {\hilit want} your code to be reused.
\item Also important to protect yourself from lawsuits.
\item I choose between the MIT license and the GPL.
\item {\hilit Don't} use Creative Commons licenses for software!
\ei

\note{
  If you don't indicate a license for your software, others {\hilit
  can't} reuse it. You need to be explicit about whether and how your
  software may be reused, by providing a license.

  I choose between the MIT license and the GNU General Public License
  (GPL). The MIT license is as open as possible: do whatever you want,
  just don't sue me. The GPL is ``viral'' (they say ``copyleft'') in that extends to
  derivative works: software that incorporates code under the GPL must
  also be under the GPL.

  The Creative Commons licenses may work for data, but they're more
  for text, music, video, and such things. They {\nhilit should not}
  be used for code, as they are not compatible with other standard
  software licenses, such as the GPL. That means that you wouldn't be
  able to mix in code that was licensed under the GPL.

\note{
  I can't emphasize this enough. If you release your software without
  a license, no one can modify it or incorporate it into their own
  software, as it's under copyright protection.

  If you want your software to be reused, pick a license, and make the
  licensing absolutely clear.

\note{
  The MIT license basically says: do whatever you want with the
  software, but be sure to include this notice, and don't sue me.

  Those are the key things you want: protect yourself from liability,

\begin{frame}{GPL-3}

\bbi
\item Use, modify, distribute, \dots
\item Don't hold the author liable.
\item Distributions must include the source code.
\item Software incorporating the work {\hilit must also be under GPL-3}.
\ei

\note{
  There is an older GPL-2. Use the GPL-3. It was updated to close
  some loopholes.

  Key additions vs MIT license: distributions of the work or
  derivatives must include source code, and derivatives must also be
  licensed under GPL-3.

\item CC BY-NC-ND {\lolit (Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs)}
\ei

\note{
  The Creative Commons licenses are really useful for things like
  manuscripts, data files, videos, web sites, and such.

  You shouldn't use them for software, as they can't be mixed with the
  GPL, and they make no explicit mention of source or object code.
  In the FAQ at Creative Commons, they explicitly recommend {\nhilit
  against} the use of CC licenses for software.

  BY means people must cite you as the originator.

  SA means that derivative works must be distributed under the same
  license (like the GPL).

  ND means the work must be distributed in its entirety, without any
  changes.

  NC means the work can't be used in a commercial setting.
}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{CC licenses: issues to consider}

\bbi
\item BY may be an unnecessary hassle.
\item CC-BY on a paper would allow a company to include it in a book
  \bi
  \item but maybe you don't care
  \ei
\item ND is {\vhilit really} restrictive
 \bi
 \item all or none
 \item no modifications at all
 \ei
\item NC means people in a company can't use it at all
 \bi
 \item might not be useable within a course
 \ei
\ei

\note{
  There are a lot of issues to consider.

  I'd recommend avoiding ND and probably also NC.

  Personally, I'm going with CC0 (by academic tradition, people should
  still cite you) or CC-BY. It means that a company could grab my
  stuff and make money off of it. But I'm fine with that. I'd rather
  see the results of my efforts put to further use.
