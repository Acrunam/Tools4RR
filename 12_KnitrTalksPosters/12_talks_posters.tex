\note{
  It's arguably less critical that presentation slides or a poster be
  reproducible. Nevertheless, there can be great personal advantage to
  the automated generation of figures and such in slides or a poster:
  if the primary data should change, or if some analysis mistake is
  discovered, it will be easier to revise the presentation.

  My primary goal is to get you to ditch Powerpoint/Keynote in favor
  of reproducible alternatives. I will primarily focus on the Beamer
  package for LaTeX, for both slides and posters. But I will also
  touch upon the use of slidify to make Markdown-based slides for a
  talk.

\begin{frame}{Powerpoint/Keynote}

\begin{minipage}[t]{0.45\textwidth}

\bbi
\item[+] Standard
\item[+] Easy to share slides
\item[+] WYSIWYG (mostly)
\item[+] Fancy animations
\ei

\end{minipage}
\hfill
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.45\textwidth}

\bbi
\item[\textendash] Font problems
\item[\textendash] Lots of copy-paste
\item[\textendash] Hard to get equations
\item[\textendash] Not reproducible
\ei

\end{minipage}

\note{
  Powerpoint and Keynote do have their advantages, the principal one
  being that everyone is using these tools, which makes it easy to
  share and exchange slides with friends.

  But we've all seen terrible font problems in important
  presentations, mostly due to incompatibilities between 
  Windows and Mac versions of Powerpoint: fonts should be, but aren't,
  embedded in the presentation.

  And insert of figures requires tedious copy-paste, usually followed
  by manual resizing and adjustment of figure placement.

  And if the figures are revised (because the data changed or some
  mistake was found in the analysis), we'll have to repeat all of
  that.

\begin{frame}[c]{\LaTeX\/ Beamer package}

\figh{Figs/Copenhagen-default-default-01.png}{0.75}

\note{
  Believe it or not, I'd mostly been making \LaTeX\/ slides using
  the {\tt article} document class: revise the page size and make the
  fonts big.

  The Beamer package for \LaTeX\/ is way easier, but I was turned off
  by the standard slides that people were producing with Beamer, such
  as the one shown: far too much junk on the screen, and on every
  single slide.

  You can get rid of all of that, and then Beamer can actually be
  quite convenient for producing slides. All of the slides I'm making
  for this course are produced with Beamer.

  There's good facility for adding simply animations (progressively
  showing or hiding different elements on the slide).

  You {\nhilit are} writing \LaTeX, so the coding can be a bit verbose.

\end{lstlisting}

\note{
  The first thing to do is to get rid of all of the junk. 

  Also, I prefer light text on a dark background.

  The tricky part is that Beamer has special names for
  everything.

  It would be best if I created a new theme, but I don't want to take
  the time to figure that out.

\begin{frame}[c,fragile]{Also, slide numbers and fonts}

% Palatino for notes
\setbeamerfont{note page}{family*=pplx,size=\footnotesize}
\end{lstlisting}

\note{
  I also want the slide number in the bottom-right, and I want a
  different font: something a bit more blocky, which I think is easier
  to read on the screen.

\begin{frame}[c,fragile]{Title slide}

\begin{lstlisting}
\title{Put title here}

\frame{
  \titlepage

\note{
  Summary of the talk, as a note.
}
} }
\end{lstlisting}

\note{
  The title slide is created with {\tt {\textbackslash}titlepage}, 
  having first defined {\tt {\textbackslash}title},
  {\tt {\textbackslash}author}, etc.

  The extra curly braces are to get the ``no slide number'' to apply
  just to the title slide. You can put notes on slides and then make a
  version that has the slide above the notes. See what I do with the
  slides for this course, or ask me for help.

\begin{frame}<handout:0>[c,fragile]{Typical slide}

\note{
  A typical slide is set between {\tt {\textbackslash}begin\{frame\}\{title\}}
  and {\tt {\textbackslash}end\{frame\}}.

  You get bullet points with the {\tt itemize} environment. I'll mess
  around a bit with {\tt {\textbackslash}vspace} and
  {\tt {\textbackslash}itemsep}. And I'll create shortcuts with
  {\tt {\textbackslash}newcommand} for these.

  I couldn't figure out how to get {\tt {\textbackslash}end\{frame\}}
  to appear in a slide, but adding a leading space worked. In
  practice, {\nhilit don't} include the space.

 \end{frame} % delete the leading space
\end{lstlisting}

\note{
  I'd typically generate figures externally and include them with
  {\tt {\textbackslash}includegraphics}. I got a good macro from Sam
  Younkin to simplify this.

  But you could use a knitr code chunk, in the same way we discussed
  with manuscripts, in the last lecture.

\begin{frame}{Summary}

\bbi
\item Use LaTeX/Beamer or Slidify to create reproducible slides.
\item Use LaTeX/Beamer to create reproducible posters.
\item Include KnitR code chunks to create figures directly.
\item Or keep the code for figures separate (which I tend to do).
\ei

\note{
  To make reproducible slides/posters, you need to dump PowerPoint.
